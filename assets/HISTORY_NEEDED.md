# History Screenshot Placeholder

**Action Required:** Add a screenshot of the Parking History screen

This should show:
- List of past parking spots
- Dates and times
- Thumbnails of parking locations
- Any parking notes

Once you have this screenshot, save it as `history.png` in this folder.

For now, the README will reference this file but it won't display until you add the actual screenshot.
