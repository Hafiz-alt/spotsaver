# Privacy Policy for SpotSaver

**Last Updated:** February 14, 2026

## Introduction

SpotSaver ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application.

## Information We Collect

SpotSaver is designed with privacy as a core principle. **We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information to external servers.**

### Data Stored Locally on Your Device

The app stores the following information **only on your device**:

1. **Location Data**: GPS coordinates of your saved parking spots
2. **Photos**: Images you capture of your parking locations (stored in app-specific storage)
3. **Notes**: Text notes you add about parking locations
4. **Vehicle Information**: Names and license plates of your vehicles
5. **Parking History**: Records of your past parking locations
6. **App Preferences**: Settings like notification preferences and active vehicle selection

All this data remains **exclusively on your device** and is never uploaded to any server or cloud service.

## Permissions We Request

### Location Permission
- **Why we need it**: To capture your GPS coordinates when you save a parking spot and calculate distance to your vehicle
- **How we use it**: Location data is only accessed when you actively save a spot or view distance information
- **What we don't do**: We do not track your location in the background or share it with third parties

### Camera Permission
- **Why we need it**: To let you take photos of your parking spot
- **How we use it**: Photos are only taken when you explicitly tap the camera button
- **What we don't do**: We do not access your camera without your action or upload photos anywhere

### Storage Permission
- **Why we need it**: To save parking spot data, photos, and app settings on your device
- **How we use it**: All data is stored in app-specific storage on your device
- **What we don't do**: We do not access files outside the app's designated storage area

### Notification Permission
- **Why we need it**: To send you parking timer reminders
- **How we use it**: Notifications are only sent for timers you set
- **What we don't do**: We do not send marketing notifications or spam

## Data Sharing

**We do not share any data with third parties.** Period.

- No analytics services
- No advertising networks
- No data brokers
- No cloud backups (unless you use your device's system backup)

## External Services

When you tap "Open in Google Maps" or "Open in Waze", the app passes your parking coordinates to those respective apps. This interaction is handled by your device's operating system and is subject to Google Maps' and Waze's own privacy policies.

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device:
- Your data security depends on your device's security (screen lock, encryption, etc.)
- If you uninstall the app, all data is permanently deleted
- We recommend using your device's built-in backup features if you want to preserve your data

## Children's Privacy

SpotSaver does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13. The app is designed for general audiences and does not require any personal information.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.

## Data Deletion

To delete all your data:
1. Uninstall the SpotSaver app from your device
2. All locally stored data will be permanently removed

Alternatively, you can clear data from your device's app settings.

**Your Privacy Matters**
